```python
with open('data.txt') as inf, open('out.txt', 'w') as outf:
	for line in inf:
		outf.write(" ".join([word.capitalize() for word in line.split()]))
		outf.write("\n")
```

data.txt
```
beaytiful is better than ugly.
explicit is better than implicit.
simple is better than complex.
complex is better than complicated.
```

out.txt
```
Beaytiful Is Better Than Ugly.
Explicit Is Better Than Implicit.
Simple Is Better Than Complex.
Complex Is Better Than Complicated.
```

使用 [上下文管理器] 管理了2个文件 data.txt + out.txt  
[读] 模式打开 [输入文件] `data.txt`   
因为 `open` 函数默认打开模式就是 [读] 因此参数省略  

[写] 模式打开 [输出文件] `out.txt` `w`

使用 `for` 循环遍历 [输入文件] 每一行  
使用 `split` 函数拆分一行中的单词  
使用 `capitalize` 函数将单词首字母=>大写  
使用 `join` 将处理好的单词拼接成更大的字符串=>分隔符为空格" "  
使用 `write` 写入输出文件

使用 `print` 函数简化输出语句
```python
with open('data.txt') as inf, open('out.txt', 'w') as outf:
	for line in inf:
		print(*[word.capitalize() for word in line.split()], file=outf)
```
